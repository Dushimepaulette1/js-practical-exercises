    <h1>Crocheting</h1>
    <p>
      Crochet is a craft technique that involves using a hooked needle to create
      fabric by interlocking loops of yarn or thread. It is similar to knitting,
      but instead of using two needles, crochet uses a single hook.
    </p>
    <h2>Why crochet?</h2>
    <p>
      Some of these restorative benefits of crocheting include combating
      anxiety, relieving stress, reducing insomnia, building self-esteem,
      depression relief, improving fine motor skills, decreasing the risk of
      Alzheimer's, and so much more. Creating art with yarn by crocheting and
      knitting can transform you.
